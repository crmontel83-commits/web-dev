    <!-- PAYMENT PLAN -->
    <section id="payment-plan" class="section">
      <div class="container">
        <h2>How the Payment Plan Works</h2>

        <h3>Project Fee</h3>
        <p>
          The total project fee for a standard website build is
          <strong>$995</strong>. This covers strategy, design, development,
          basic integrations, and launch support for one site.
        </p>

        <h3>Monthly Payments</h3>
        <p>
          You have the option to pay this fee in
          <strong>monthly installments</strong> until the full $995 is reached.
          Once your payment plan is set up, you can continue paying each month
          until the total is complete.
        </p>

        <h3>Non-Refundable Payments</h3>
        <p>
          All payments made toward the $995 project fee are considered a
          <strong>non-refundable deposit</strong>. These payments reserve space
          in my schedule and cover project preparation, communication, and
          planning time.
        </p>
        <p>
          I begin design and development work on your project
          <strong>after the full $995 has been paid</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you decide to cancel or pause before the full amount is paid, any
          payments already made will be retained and
          <strong>will not be refunded</strong>. In some cases, at my
          discretion, your paid amount may be applied as a credit toward a
          future service within 12 months.
        </p>
        <p>
          By starting a payment plan, you acknowledge and agree to these terms.
        </p>
